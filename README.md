# Weather bug

Tells the weather by zipcode using https://openweathermap.org/

## Installation
 open index.html
 or click https://cherylcarpenter.github.io/weatherbug/index.html
 or for full front end, run 'npm i' and then run gulp from terminal

## Tech stack
I used Bulma framework just because that's what i'm using currently but I am expert in Bootstrap.
I plugged this into my current front-end workflow so there may be a bit 'extra'.
I am new to webpack, as in, this week,  so there are a few implemention pain points in learning that workflow, as far as ESCM6 notations and exporting modules in global scopes.
Overall I am enjoying running my js compiling at the same time as my gulp/sass workflow as seen in my gulp.js file.

## Usage

Given parameters of logo, color, and submit button.
To implemnet in WordPress I'd like to know which parts of the banner/widget the content person nees to be editable.
I would think the logo, headline, and verbiage should be dynamic.
This looks like a simple custom widget, so i'd register a custom widget area with the needed fields, and hook into which ever templates we want the banner on.
It could also be selected in a content area, I'd probably use advanced custom fields for maximum customization.
